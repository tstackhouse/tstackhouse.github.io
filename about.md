I currently work as a front-end engineer for [radius180](http://www.radius180.com) in Cherry Hill, NJ.  I work
almost exclusively with JavaScript, using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), in concert with
[Marionette.js](http://marionettejs.com/), and a number of helper libraries.  I'm also pretty handy with CSS and
front-end UI frameworks, including working with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS preprocessors.  In the past, I've also done extensive work with
[Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/), [ExpressionEngine](https://ellislab.com/expressionengine), and vanilla
[PHP](http://www.php.net/).
