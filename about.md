Welcome to my personal blog.  I post things here that I hope other people will find useful.  Bits of code,
recipes, interesting adventures in home brewing or just homeownership in general.  Nothing is off-limits and
hopefully you'll find something that interests you too!

I currently work as a front-end engineer for [radius180](http://www.radius180.com) in Cherry Hill, NJ.  I work
almost exclusively with JavaScript, using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), in concert with
[Marionette.js](http://marionettejs.com/), and a number of helper libraries.  I'm also pretty handy with CSS and
front-end UI frameworks, including working with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and
[HTML 5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/).  I've also worked with both [Less](http://lesscss.org/) and
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS preprocessors.  In the past, I've also done extensive work with
[Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/), [ExpressionEngine](https://ellislab.com/expressionengine), and vanilla
[PHP](http://www.php.net/).

## Geeky Stuff
