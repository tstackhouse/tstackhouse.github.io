I keep a fairly simple weekday dinner routine to keep time and costs down during the week and letting me have some
downtime.  In that spirit, every Tuesday in our house is grilled cheese and tomato soup night.  It's simple, quick to
prepare, and (relatively) healthy, provided one goes easy on the butter. That said, as someone who has actively been
trying to avoid processed foods, I have a certain soft spot in my heart for Campbell's tomato soup.  It reminds me of my
childhood, and made with milk it's creamy and oh so satisfying.

Well, a couple Tuesdays ago I went to make dinner and lo my usual stash of a few cans of Campbell's was gone!  I had
forgotten to restock and was left with the possibility of no soup with our sandwiches.  Necessity being what it is, I
pulled out a few ingredents and hit pu the internet to build a quick recipe for my own homemade tomato soup, and this
was the result.  It's creamy buy not heavy, and distinctly tomato-y, and made right, it can even be vegan!

The first time I made this I didn't add any baking soda, and it was noticibly acidic, even after adding some sugar to
attempt to balance the flavor a bit.  The next time I used the baking soda and it brought it right in line.  The amount
can be varies to your taste.
